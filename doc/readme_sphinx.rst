--------
Overview
--------

WESTPA is a package for constructing and running stochastic simulations using the "weighted ensemble" approach 
of Huber and Kim (1996) (see overview_). 

For use of WESTPA please cite the following:

Obtaining and Installing WESTPA
--------------------------------

WESTPA is developed and tested on Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and Mac OS X.

Before installing WESTPA, you will need to first install the Python 3 version provided by the latest free `Anaconda Python distribution`_. After installing the Anaconda Python distribution, either add the Python executable to your $PATH or set the environment variable WEST_PYTHON::

    export WEST_PYTHON=/opt/anaconda/bin/python3

We recommend obtaining the latest release of WESTPA by downloading the corresponding tar.gz file from the `releases page`_. After downloading the file, unpack the file and install WESTPA by executing the following::

    tar xvzf westpa-master.tar.gz
    cd westpa
    ./setup.sh

A westpa.sh script is created during installation, and will set the following environment variables::

    WEST_ROOT
    WEST_BIN
    WEST_PYTHON

These environment variables must be set in order to run WESTPA on your computing cluster.

To define environment variables post-installation, simply source the 
``westpa.sh`` script in the ``westpa`` directory from the command line
or your setup scripts.

FAQ
###

Responses to frequently asked questions (FAQ) can be found in the following page: 
  
- `Frequently Asked Questions <https://github.com/westpa/westpa/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions>`__


A mailing list for WESTPA is available, at which one can ask questions (or see
if a question one has was previously addressed). This is the preferred means
for obtaining help and support. See http://groups.google.com/group/westpa-users
to sign up or search archived messages.

Further, all WESTPA command-line tools (located in ``westpa/bin``) provide detailed help when
given the -h/--help option.

Finally, while WESTPA is a powerful tool that enables expert simulators to access much longer 
timescales than is practical with standard simulations, there can be a steep learning curve to 
figuring out how to effectively run the simulations on your computing resource of choice. 
For serious users who have completed the online tutorials and are ready for production simulations 
of their system, we invite you to contact Lillian Chong (ltchong AT pitt DOT edu) about spending 
a few days with her lab and/or setting up video conferencing sessions to help you get your 
simulations off the ground.
