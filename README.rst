--------
Overview
--------

WESTPA is a package for constructing and running stochastic simulations using the "weighted ensemble" approach 
of Huber and Kim (1996). For use of WESTPA please cite the following:

Zwier, M.C., Adelman, J.L., Kaus, J.W., Pratt, A.J., Wong, K.F., Rego, N.B., Suarez, E., Lettieri, S.,
Wang, D. W., Grabe, M., Zuckerman, D. M., and Chong, L. T. "WESTPA: An Interoperable, Highly 
Scalable Software Package For Weighted Ensemble Simulation and Analysis," J. Chem. Theory Comput., 11: 800âˆ’809 (2015). 

See this page_ and this powerpoint_ for an overview of weighted ensemble simulation.

Requirements
------------

WESTPA is written in Python and requires version 3.6 or later. WESTPA further
requires a large number of scientific software libraries for Python and other
languages. The simplest way to meet these requirements is to download the
Anaconda Python distribution from www.continuum.io (free for all users).

WESTPA currently runs on Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and
Mac OS X. It is developed and tested on x86_64 machines running Linux.

Obtaining and Installing WESTPA
--------------------------------

WESTPA is developed and tested on Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and Mac OS X.

We recommend installing WESTPA through conda. See the quick install instructions on our `wiki`_ for how to do this. To install from source (not recommended), please continue reading.

Before installing WESTPA, we recommend you to first install the Python 3 version provided by the latest free `Anaconda Python distribution`_. Create a new python environment for the install with the following::

    conda create -n westpa-2.0 python=3.7

We recommend obtaining the latest release of WESTPA by downloading the corresponding tar.gz file from the `releases page`_. After downloading the file, unpack the file and install WESTPA by executing the following::

    tar xvzf westpa-main.tar.gz
    cd westpa
    conda activate westpa-2.0
    python -m pip install -e .

Getting started
---------------

High-level tutorials of how to use the WESTPA software can be found here_.
Further, all WESTPA command-line tools provide detailed help when
given the -h/--help option.

Finally, while WESTPA is a powerful tool that enables expert simulators to access much longer 
timescales than is practical with standard simulations, there can be a steep learning curve to 
figuring out how to effectively run the simulations on your computing resource of choice. 
For serious users who have completed the online tutorials and are ready for production simulations 
of their system, we invite you to contact Lillian Chong (ltchong AT pitt DOT edu) about spending 
a few days with her lab and/or setting up video conferencing sessions to help you get your 
simulations off the ground.
